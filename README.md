## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Joshua Wong, and I am a computer science student at the University of Maryland interested in exploring all areas of computer science!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a [Battleship CLI Game](https://github.com/wongjoshua2005/Battleship-Game) in Java to strengthen my understanding of game logic, data structures, and algorithms.
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning advanced programming concepts in computer science and exploring areas such as web development and game development.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source projects or games that involve problem-solving and clean code.
